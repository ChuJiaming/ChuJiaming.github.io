# My Personal Website

<div align="center">

**A simple, clean, and responsive [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme for academics.**

**Generate from Templete [alshedivat/al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio).**

To run the website locally, you need to have **Docker** and **Docker compose**.

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up
```

Then, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080/`.

---

Other questions, you may need to install **Node.JS** in local environment or docker container and run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

This command will install the necessary packages, such as prettier, for the website to run. Or the format check in github workflow will fail.
